Contributing to Fracture

Thanks for your interest!

Fracture is a personal tool born from specific needs (safe evolution of local AI scripts). I welcome:
- Bug fixes (with clear reproduction steps)
- Typos/docs improvements
- Small usability polish

Please **open an Issue first** for anything larger than a typo fix. Big changes (new features, rewrites, dependency additions) are unlikely to be merged — the goal is to keep it lightweight, portable, and focused.

No external dependencies beyond stdlib + tkinter. No compiled extensions.

Pull requests should:
- Target one clear thing
- Preserve the section-based philosophy
- Not touch [PROTECTED] sections in the code

I may close PRs without merging — it's not personal, just keeping the project on its intended path.

Thanks for understanding and helping keep Fracture sharp 🗡️
